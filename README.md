# tf2-StopOffclassingToMid
please. just stop it.

this plugin prevents people from playing offclasses in the first 30 seconds of every round.

it will forcibly slay you if you attempt to get around this.

this is meant for competitive 6s pugs, but i have not bothered to add in an auto checker that makes sure the game mode being played is 6s. that may get added later, stay tuned.

may be buggy.
